# FreshFruitsDetection
In this project, simple CNN convolutional neural network is used to detect fresh fruits, and the accuracy rate can reach more than 86%, and the loss is about 1.22. The result is relatively satisfactory. I hope this project can improve your understanding and use of CNN convolutional neural network.
